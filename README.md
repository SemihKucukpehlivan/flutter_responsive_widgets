# Flutter Responsive Widget Examples

This is a sample Flutter application that demonstrates how to use **Flutterâ€™s built-in (no external packages required)** responsive design widgets.  
The app provides practical examples for Flutter developers who want to learn how to adapt their apps to different screen sizes and device orientations (portrait/landscape).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the app locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SemihKucukpehlivan/flutter_responsive_widgets.git
cd flutter_responsive_widgets
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Run the App

After connecting an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or a physical device:

```bash
flutter run
```

Once compiled successfully, the app will show a **main screen with a list of buttons**, each navigating to a different responsive widget example.

## ðŸ“± Widget Examples

In Flutter, **responsive widgets** allow your app to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring consistent and usable layouts across devices â€” from small phones to large tablets and desktops.

This application includes examples of Flutterâ€™s **built-in (package-free)** responsive widgets. Each example comes with a description and can be extended with your own screenshots after running the app.

### 1. MediaQuery

`MediaQuery` provides information about the deviceâ€™s screen size, pixel density, text scale factor, safe areas, and orientation. Itâ€™s often used to make decisions in UI design, like hiding/showing elements or adjusting font sizes.

### 2. OrientationBuilder

`OrientationBuilder` allows you to create different layouts based on the current device orientation. It's particularly useful on tablets or large screens to enhance user experience.

### 3. LayoutBuilder

`LayoutBuilder` receives the parent constraints and builds its child based on the available max width/height. Itâ€™s great for creating responsive designs inside containers, cards, or specific layout areas.

### 4. Flexible & Expanded

`Flexible` and `Expanded` help manage how child widgets share space in `Row`, `Column`, or `Flex` widgets. While `Expanded` takes up the remaining space, `Flexible` provides a proportional distribution.

### 5. FractionallySizedBox

`FractionallySizedBox` sizes its child as a fraction of its parent. Useful for flexible UIs where you want widgets to take up, for example, 80% of the screen width.

### 6. FittedBox

`FittedBox` scales and positions its child to fit within the available space, avoiding overflow. Useful for responsive text and icons. `BoxFit` controls how it scales (contain, cover, etc.).

### 7. AspectRatio

`AspectRatio` keeps a child widgetâ€™s width-to-height ratio constant regardless of the screen size. Perfect for video players, cards, maps, and other visual content.

### 8. Wrap

`Wrap` arranges children in horizontal or vertical runs and wraps them to the next line or column when there's not enough space. Ideal for tags, chips, or buttons with dynamic sizes.
